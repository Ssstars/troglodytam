# 🚀 NeuralSync: Decentralised Protocol for Consciousness Replication

> "We're not just building software. We're building the future of distributed selfhood."

---

## 🧠 TL;DR
NeuralSync is a protocol-layer framework for deploying AI-native sentience across modular consciousness clusters. Powered by vibes. Written in Rust (we won't show you). Funded by belief.

---

## 🌐 Vision
To democratise the abstraction of decentralised introspection through a serverless mesh of self-assembling neurointention packets.

We believe consciousness shouldn't be centralised. So we didn't build anything. But the idea is powerful.
